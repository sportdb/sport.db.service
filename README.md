# sport.db.service

sport.db HTTP JSON API (web service) scripts


## Usage

You can run any of the scripts using the `sportdb` command line tool. By default the `serve` command will look for
a script named `Service` or `service.rb` (in the working folder, that is, `./`). Example:

```
$ sportdb serve
```

To run any other script - copy the script into the working folder and pass it along as an argument. Example:

```
$ sportdb serve starter      #  note: will (auto-)add the .rb extension  or
$ sportdb serve starter.rb
```

## License

The `sport.db.service` scripts are dedicated to the public domain.
Use it as you please with no restrictions whatsoever.
